      <h1>🎉 Happy Birthday, BASMA 🎉</h1>
      <p>
        Hey you,<br><br>
        Yes, <strong>you</strong>, the incredible, hilarious, beautiful human who somehow decided I was worth spending time with (questionable choice, but I’m not complaining).<br><br>
        Today is the day the universe upgraded — because <strong>you were born</strong>. And honestly? It’s been thriving ever since.<br><br>
        I don’t know what we are exactly — maybe it’s complicated, maybe it’s undefined, but one thing I know <strong>for sure</strong> is:<br>
        <strong>You matter to me. A lot.</strong><br><br>
        I love your humor, your personality, and honestly... everything about you.<br><br>
        So here’s to you, Basma —<br>
        To your dreams, your silly jokes, your unmatched energy, and that spark in your eyes.<br><br>
        May this year bring you as much joy as you bring to everyone around you (which is A LOT — trust me, I’ve done the math).<br><br>
        And even if we never quite figure out what to call “us,” know that I’ll always be rooting for you, cherishing you, and secretly planning to steal you away with bad puns and chocolate. 🍫<br><br>
        <strong>Happy Birthday, my not-quite-defined-but-totally-adored human.</strong><br>
        Let’s keep making memories that are fun, strange, sweet, and a little bit stupid — just like us. 💛
      </p>
      <p class="signature">— With all my love,<br>your favorite weirdo 💌</p>
